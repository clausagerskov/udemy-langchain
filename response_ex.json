It is well known that gamma oscillations are increased when ketamine is administered to rodents and humans, and increases in the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) have also been observed.\nAims:\nTo elucidate the cellular substrate of the increase in network activity and synchrony observed by sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine, the aim was to investigate spike timing and regularity and determine how this is affected by the animal\u2019s motor state.\nMethods:\nSingle unit activity and local field potentials from the auditory cortex of awake, freely moving rats were recorded with microelectrode arrays during an ASSR paradigm.\nResults:\nKetamine administration yielded a significant increase in ASSR power and phase locking, both significantly modulated by motor activity. Before drug administration, putative fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) were significantly more entrained to the stimulus than putative pyramidal neurons (PYRs). The degree of entrainment significantly increased at lower doses of ketamine (3 and 10\u2009mg/kg for FSIs, 10\u2009mg/kg for PYRs). At the highest dose (30\u2009mg/kg), a strong increase in tonic firing of PYRs was observed.\nConclusions:\nThese findings suggest an involvement of FSIs in the increased network synchrony and provide a possible cellular explanation for the well-documented effects of ketamine-induced increase in power and synchronicity during ASSR. The results support the importance to evaluate different motor states separately for more translational preclinical research.", "url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/IFBDY9WTX2V3EK4BUYRI/full"}, {"name": "Activity-state dependent reversal of ketamine-induced resting state EEG effects by clozapine and naltrexone in the freely moving rat", "publisher": "Frontiers in Psychiatry, Psychopharmacology", "published_on": {"day": 27, "month": 1, "year": 2022}, "description": "Ketamine is a non-competitive N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist used in the clinic to initiate and maintain anaesthesia; it induces dissociative states and has emerged as a breakthrough therapy for major depressive disorder. Using local field potential recordings in freely moving rats, we studied resting state EEG profiles induced by co-administering ketamine with either: clozapine, a highly efficacious antipsychotic; or naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist reported to block the acute antidepressant effects of ketamine. As human electroencephalography (EEG) is predominantly recorded in a passive state, head-mounted accelerometers were used with rats to determine active and passive states at a high temporal resolution to offer the highest translatability. In general, pharmacological effects for the three drugs were more pronounced in (or restricted to) the passive state. Specifically, during inactive periods clozapine induced increases in delta (0.1\u20134 Hz), gamma (30\u201360 Hz) and higher frequencies (>100 Hz). Importantly, it reversed the ketamine-induced reduction in low beta power (10\u201320 Hz) and potentiated ketamine-induced increases in gamma and high frequency oscillations (130\u2013160 Hz). Naltrexone inhibited frequencies above 50 Hz and significantly reduced the ketamine-induced increase in high frequency oscillations. However, some frequency band changes, such as clozapine-induced decreases in delta power, were only seen in locomoting rats. These results emphasise the potential in differentiating between activity states to capture drug effects and translate to human resting state EEG. Furthermore, the differential reversal of ketamine-induced EEG effects by clozapine and naltrexone may have implications for the understanding of psychotomimetic as well as rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine.", "url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.737295/full?utm_source=F-NTF&utm_medium=EMLX&utm_campaign=PRD_FEOPS_20170000_ARTICLE"}, {"name": "Pharmaco-Electroencephalographic Reponses in the Rat Differ Between Active and Inactive Locomotor States", "publisher": "European Journal of Neuroscience", "published_on": {"day": 1, "month": 2, "year": 2019}, "description": "Quantitative electroencephalography from freely\u2010moving rats is commonly used as a translational tool for predicting drug\u2010effects in humans. We hypothesized that drug\u2010effects may be expressed differently depending on whether the rat is in active locomotion or sitting still during recording sessions, and proposed automatic state\u2010detection as a viable tool for estimating drug\u2010effects free of hypo\u2010/hyperlocomotion induced effects. We aimed at developing a fully automatic and validated method for detecting two behavioral states: active and inactive, in one\u2010second intervals and to use the method for evaluating ketamine, DOI, d\u2010cycloserine, d\u2010amphetamine, and diazepam effects specifically within each state. The developed state\u2010detector attained high precision with more than 90% of the detected time correctly classified, and multiple differences between the two detected states were discovered. Ketamine\u2010induced delta activity was found specifically related to locomotion. Ketamine and DOI suppressed theta and beta oscillations exclusively during inactivity. Characteristic gamma and high\u2010frequency oscillations (HFO) enhancements of the NMDAR and 5HT2A modulators, speculated associated with locomotion, were profound and often largest during the inactive state. State\u2010specific analyses, theoretically eliminating biases from altered occurrence of locomotion, revealed only few effects of d\u2010amphetamine and diazepam.

Cognitive deterioration in AD is delayed by symptomatic treatment with donepezil and other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs). However, the efficacy of symptomatic monotherapy is insufficient. Combining 5-HT receptor antagonists with AChEIs represents a promising new approach for symptomatic treatment of AD. The selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron decreases the activity of interneurons with a concomitant increase in the activity of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus of freely moving rats. Additionally, 5-HT3 receptor antagonism modulates acetylcholine release in rat cortex and hippocampus. We investigated the effects of ondansetron alone and in combination with donepezil on hippocampal oscillations using in vivo electrophysiology. Neuronal network oscillations were recorded in the dorsal hippocampus during electrical stimulation of the brainstem pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus in urethane-anaesthetised rats. In addition, potential pharmacokinetic interactions between donepezil and ondansetron were assessed. Ondansetron alone did not affect hippocampal network oscillations. Donepezil dose-dependently increased hippocampal theta and gamma power during PPT stimulation. Ondansetron (0.3\u202fmg/kg, i.v.) potentiated theta and gamma responses to 0.2\u202fmg/kg donepezil and prolonged theta and gamma responses to 0.3\u202fmg/kg donepezil. These effects could not be attributed to pharmacokinetic interactions between the compounds. This study demonstrates that ondansetron potentiates the effects of donepezil on elicited neuronal oscillations and suggests that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists may be beneficial as adjunctive therapy to AChEIs for the symptomatic treatment of cognitive deficits in AD.", "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30243914"}, {"name": "The 5-HT6 receptor antagonist idalopirdine potentiates the effects of donepezil on gamma oscillations in the frontal cortex of anesthetized and awake rats without affecting sleep-wake architecture.", "publisher": "Neuropharmacology, Vol 113, Pt A, Pages 45-59", "published_on": {"day": 16, "month": 9, "year": 2016}, "description": "The 5-HT6 receptor is a promising target for cognitive disorders, in particular for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The high affinity and selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist idalopirdine (LuAE58054) is currently in development for mild-moderate AD as adjunct therapy to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs). We studied the effects of idalopirdine alone and in combination with the AChEI donepezil on cortical function using two in vivo electrophysiological methods. Neuronal network oscillations in the frontal cortex were measured during electrical stimulation of the brainstem nucleus pontis oralis (nPO) in the anesthetized rat and by an electroencephalogram (EEG) in the awake, freely moving rat. In conjunction with the EEG study, we investigated the effects of idalopirdine and donepezil on sleep-wake architecture using telemetric polysomnography. Idalopirdine (2 mg/kg i.v.) increased gamma power in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during nPO stimulation. Donepezil (0.3 & 1 mg/kg i.v.) also increased cortical gamma power and pretreatment with idalopirdine (2 mg/kg i.v.) potentiated and prolonged the effects of donepezil. Similarly, donepezil (1 and 3 mg/kg s.c.) dose-dependently increased frontal cortical gamma power in the freely moving rat and pretreatment with idalopirdine (10 mg/kg p.o.) augmented the effect of donepezil 1 mg/kg. Analysis of the sleep-wake architecture showed that donepezil (1 and 3 mg/kg s.c.) dose-dependently delayed sleep onset and decreased the time spent in both REM and non REM sleep stages. In contrast, idalopirdine (10 mg/kg p.o.) did not affect sleep-wake architecture nor the effects of donepezil. In summary, we show that idalopirdine potentiates the effects of donepezil on frontal cortical gamma oscillations, a pharmacodynamic biomarker associated with cognition, without modifying the effects of donepezil on sleep.

The ligands investigated in this study are chosen to be corresponding to the G protein-coupled receptors \u00b5-opioid, serotonin 2B (5-HT2B) and metabotropic glutamate D5. They are selected due to the availability of pharmacological drug-molecule binding data for these receptors. Feedback and deep belief artificial neural network architectures (NNs) were chosen to perform the task of aiding drugdesign. This is done by training on structural features, selected using a \"minimum redundancy, maximum relevance\"-test, and testing for successful prediction of categorized binding strength. An extensive comparison of the neural network performances was made in order to select the optimal architecture. Deep belief networks, trained with greedy learning algorithms, showed superior performance in prediction over the simple feedback NNs. The best networks obtained scores of more than 90 % accuracy in predicting the degree of binding drug molecules to the mentioned receptors and with a maximal Matthew`s coefficient of 0.925. The performance of 8 category networks (8 output classes for binding strength) obtained a prediction accuracy of above 60 %. After training the networks, tests were done on how well the systems could be used as an aid in designing candidate drug molecules. Specifically, it was shown how a selection of chemical characteristics could give the lowest observed IC50 values, meaning largest bio-effect pr. nM substance, around 0.03-0.06 nM. These ligand characteristics could be total number of atoms, their types etc. In conclusion, deep belief networks trained on drug-molecule structures were demonstrated as powerful computational tools, able to aid in drug-design in a fast and cheap fashion, compared to conventional pharmacological techniques.", "url": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26463104"}], "accomplishment_honors_awards": [], "accomplishment_patents": [], "accomplishment_courses": [{"name": "Electronic Structure Methods in Material Physics, Chemistry and Biology", "number": ""}, {"name": "Experimental Surface Physics", "number": ""}, {"name": "LabChip-2: Physics of Lab-on-chip systems", "number": ""}, {"name": "Micro-2: MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS)", "number": ""}, {"name": "Molecular Biophysics: Protein, Structure and Dynamics", "number": ""}, {"name": "Nano-2: Nanosystems Engineering", "number": ""}, {"name": "Neuro Physics (special course)", "number": ""}, {"name": "Prediction by Neural Network of Ligand Binding to Neuro Receptors (special course)", "number": ""}, {"name": "Project in Biophysics and Complex Systems", "number": ""}, {"name": "Single Molecule - and Nanoscale-Spectroscopy", "number": ""}], "accomplishment_projects": [], "accomplishment_test_scores": [], "volunteer_work": [], "certifications": [{"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 11, "year": 2019}, "ends_at": null, "name": "Japanese Intermediate 1 Certificate", "license_number": null, "display_source": "lingq.com", "authority": "LingQ.com", "url": "https://www.lingq.com/en/certificate/BSlhVW1GC2h0aEhuAFAV/"}, {"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 11, "year": 2017}, "ends_at": null, "name": "Deep Learning Nanodegree", "license_number": null, "display_source": "udacity.com", "authority": "Udacity", "url": "https://confirm.udacity.com/UCVDGHKJ"}, {"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 5, "year": 2018}, "ends_at": null, "name": "Data Analyst Nanodegree", "license_number": null, "display_source": "udacity.com", "authority": "Udacity", "url": "https://confirm.udacity.com/HKMTU5L2"}, {"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 10, "year": 2019}, "ends_at": null, "name": "Advanced Data Science with IBM", "license_number": null, "display_source": "coursera.org", "authority": "Coursera", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/NFSXUWX355HD?utm_medium=certificate&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=copybutton_certificate"}, {"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 6, "year": 2021}, "ends_at": null, "name": "Cluster Analysis", "license_number": null, "display_source": "credly.com", "authority": "statistics.com", "url": "https://www.credly.com/badges/8ed4fcb3-725b-4689-8f23-18eb9cc8c316?source=linked_in_profile"}, {"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 3, "year": 2022}, "ends_at": null, "name": "Responsible Data Science", "license_number": null, "display_source": "credly.com", "authority": "statistics.com", "url": "https://www.credly.com/badges/b827ac8b-1593-4c26-86cc-46cd42e42ea9/public_url"}], "connections": 418, "people_also_viewed": [{"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/jkazan?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAABy6kJMBWIKuiNpcm7FGJgeIVntCBVAXLFY", "name": "Justinas Kazanavicius", "summary": "Senior Data Scientist at PS AI Labs", "location": null}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramon-perez-97a87a41?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAjZb-4B7jrNvUOSUrs9SwoRn0TgMgmRRGQ", "name": "Ramon Perez", "summary": "AI Solutions Director - Elder Research || Executive Director - Digital Democracy Project", "location": null}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/larry-berk-3822842?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAABlXRIBBTRoVNVm9vSfiYMBlrvHcjEEBhI", "name": "Larry Berk", "summary": "Lead Data Scientist (Machine Learning, Decision Science, Generative AI, VP)", "location": null}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/careswartz?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAACh4ycBp31no6bs2izpX8nIqGhBl0-RJzI", "name": "Caroline Swartz, MA", "summary": "Communications Manager at Elder Research with expertise in Business Communications and Branding.", "location": null}, {"link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/thordurfjalarsson?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAACoazEABPqf_qNurRI-5PLGU7BRitwlNAqY", "name": "Thordur Pall Fjalarsson", "summary": "Quantitative Risk Analyst at Nordea", "location": null}], "recommendations": ["Bettina Laursen\n\n\n\nI have had the pleasure of working with Claus for 3 years at Lundbeck, collaborating on designing and developing a novel state-of-the-art EEG analysis platform for advanced analysis of rodent electrophysiological data.
